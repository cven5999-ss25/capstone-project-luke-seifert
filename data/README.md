## General information

1.  Title of Dataset:  WFP Life-Cycle Costing Data

This data has been collected for Water For People (WFP) - Malawi. WFP builds
piped water schemes for rural communities, either from scratch or upgrading
an existing handpump. Once the piped schemes are completed, they are handed 
over to the community. Communities are having trouble funding the repair and 
maintenance costs associated with piped water scheme ownership, so this data
has been collected to help identify the best practices in the rural water 
access sphere. It is specifically focused on the costs incurred by these 
schemes and the revenue they are able to generate, identifying the finance gap
and how to best bridge the gap.
